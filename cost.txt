We are taking the difference between the prediction of an output neuron and the target label to find the error. We can then take the average of those output neurons to find the total error.  This gives us the ability to change the weights and biases in order to modify that prediction value in order to lower the error. It's a proper cost function because it provides us the ability to update the neural network so that it can learn.
